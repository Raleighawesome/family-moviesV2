/**
 * Server-Side AI Tools
 *
 * These functions are designed to be called by the AI chat system.
 * Each tool performs a specific movie-related operation and returns structured data.
 *
 * All tools require:
 * - Input validation via Zod schemas
 * - householdId for multi-tenancy
 * - Optional profileId for user-specific operations
 *
 * Tools respect household preferences (allowed ratings, max runtime, blocked keywords)
 * and enforce RLS policies at the database level.
